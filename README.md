# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. In this project, I will help Jeremy to: 

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes

Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots

Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

•	The vehicle_length and ground_clearance were variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

•	The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is much smaller than the significance level.

•	This linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the r-squared value is 71.5% 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Even though the overall variance is 62.29, the third lot is 170.3

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.

What metric or metrics are you going to test?

What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

What data is needed to run the statistical test?
